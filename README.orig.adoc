.Variables - ansible-user
[%autowidth]
|===
| Variable | Type | Default | Comments

| `manage_ansible_user` | `bool` | `true` | Whether or not to manage the ansible user. If set to false the rest of the options in this section are ignored.
| `ansible_user` | `str` | `ansible` | The name of the ansible user
| `ansible_user_password` | `str` | `null` | The encoded password for the ansible user (use `mkpasswd --method=SHA-512` to generate, if left as null it will lock the variable)
| `ansible_user_regenerate_ssh_key` | `str` | `never` | Whether or not to regenerate the ansible user's ssh key. When set to never, if a key already exists (even if it does not match the specified type and size) it will not be regenerated. When set to `always` it will always regenerate the key. When set to `on_change` it will only regenerate the key if the type or size do not match the specified values.
| `ansible_user_ssh_key_type` | `str` | `ssh-ed25519` | The type of ssh key to generate for the ansible user

| `ansible_user_ssh_key_dir` | `str` | `~/.ssh` | The directory (on the computer running ansible) to store the ansible user's ssh key. This is by default set to ~/.ssh since it is assumed that the ansible nodes are more perminant that VM's would be and you will want to keep the key around for future use.
| `ansible_user_ssh_key_name` | `str` | `id_ed25519-ansible` | The name of the ssh key to generate/use for the ansible user

[[public_vars]]
== üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[tags]]
== üè∑Ô∏è Tags

// Checkout https://github.com/tribe29/ansible-collection-tribe29.checkmk/blob/main/roles/server/README.md#tags
// for an awesome example of grouping tasks using tags

Tasks are tagged with the following
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html#adding-tags-to-roles[tags]:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Tag | Purpose

2+| This role does not have officially documented tags yet.

// | download-xyz
// |
// | install-prerequisites
// |
// | install
// |
// | create-xyz
// |
|===

You can use Ansible to skip tasks, or only run certain tasks by using these tags. By default, all tasks are run when no tags are specified.

[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.



[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/bvierra/ansible-roles[
many compatible purpose-specific roles of mine].

The machine needs to be prepared.
In CI, this is done in `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:
